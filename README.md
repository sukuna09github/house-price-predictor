# 🏠 House Price Predictor - Streamlit App

A simple yet powerful web application built using **Streamlit** and **scikit-learn** that predicts California housing prices based on features such as `total_rooms`, `housing_median_age`, and more using **Linear Regression** and **XGBoost**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project uses the **California Housing dataset** to train a regression model that predicts the `median_house_value` for a given set of housing characteristics. It provides an interactive interface where users can input values and receive real-time predictions, along with evaluation metrics and visualizations.

---

## 🔍 Features

- 🧠 Trained with **Linear Regression** and **XGBoost**
- 📊 Live model evaluation: MAE, RMSE, R² Score
- 📈 Regression line plotted over actual data
- 🧮 Accepts multiple inputs like:
  - Total Rooms
  - Housing Median Age
  - Total Bedrooms
  - Population
  - Households
  - Median Income
- 🌐 Built with **Streamlit** for web-based interaction
